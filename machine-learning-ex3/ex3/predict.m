function p = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label of an input given a trained neural network
%   p = PREDICT(Theta1, Theta2, X) outputs the predicted label of X given the
%   trained weights of a neural network (Theta1, Theta2)

% Useful values
m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(Theta2, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned neural network. You should set p to a 
%               vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
%
% Hint: The max function might come in useful. In particular, the max
%       function can also return the index of the max element, for more
%       information see 'help max'. If your examples are in rows, then, you
%       can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max for each row.

% Accounting for x0, which includes all ones
c = [ones(m, 1) X];

% Finding the activation values of layer 2
a2 = sigmoid(c * Theta1');

% Accounting for a0, which includes all ones
a2 = [ones(size(a2, 1), 1), a2];

% Finding the output of the neural network
h = sigmoid(a2 * Theta2');

% Searching for max values and placing their locations in p
[max_values, p] = max(h, [], 2);

% Added because from output, it was observed that the prediction was
% consistently 10 for every "0" image. Since, from my guess, there is an
% indexing issue related to MATLAB, so for everytime p predicts 10, I have
% made it predict 0, so it has consistent results. I realize that, for a
% different problem, this approach cannot always be hard-coded.

if (p == 10)
    p = 0;
end
